1)
the program show how the class DodgyBankAccount and SecureBankAccount works and put in evidance the difference between them.

2)
In the class DodgyBankAccount the attributes are defined as public, is not good to have access directly to the class attributes.
the attribute AccountNumber is not defined as read only, so it is possible have a misused.
the attribute RewardAmount is not defined properly as a magic number.
in the class SecureBankAccount the attributes are defined as private so are well-encapsulated and
the attribute _accountNumber is defined as read only.


3)
the method DepositAmount(int amount) have a call to another method! AddReward(). Single Responsibility Principle not respected.
the name for the method GetAccountBalanceDetails is not completely clear.
the name of the method DisplayAccountBalanceDetails is better for clearer abstraction.
